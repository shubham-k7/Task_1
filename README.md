# Task_1

To run the Algorithm, choose an index between 0 to 3914. Since we require the Parse tree for the algorithm and Stanford Parser is a heavy download, I chose to use the Parsed trees[present in nltk] to showcase the working of the algorithm. 

To run the Algo, choose index between 0 to 3914.
Output shows the Main tense of the sentence.

The first trivial approach lists all the Verb Phrases tagged by the parser in the means to create a potential tense tag list of a sentence.
